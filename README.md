# 🎬 Netflix Customer Churn Prediction System

A real-world, end-to-end **Machine Learning project** that predicts customer churn for a Netflix-like streaming platform using user behavior, engagement metrics, and sentiment analysis.  
This project is designed and developed by a **team of 5**, following **industry-standard GitHub workflows**.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for subscription-based platforms like Netflix.  
The goal of this project is to:

- Identify users who are likely to **cancel their subscription**
- Analyze **behavioral and engagement patterns**
- Help businesses take **proactive retention actions**

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- Multi-source data integration (users, watch history, searches, recommendations, reviews)
- Advanced data cleaning & feature engineering
- Machine learning models for churn prediction
- Explainable AI using feature importance (SHAP – optional)
- Scalable design suitable for cloud deployment

---

## 📊 Datasets Used

- `users.csv` – User profile & subscription data
- `watch_history.csv` – Viewing behavior
- `search_logs.csv` – Content discovery behavior
- `recommendation_logs.csv` – Recommendation interactions
- `reviews.csv` – Ratings & sentiment analysis

> ⚠️ Raw datasets are kept unchanged to maintain data integrity.
